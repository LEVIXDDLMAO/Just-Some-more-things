Hello, I've made this repo as a way to aplogize to some people, I'm not exactly good with apologies, but I'll try anyways.

# Memehoovys apology

I'm not proud for what I've done. I truly am not, I've broken a promise or two between friends, all because I posted NSFW when I was a minor, and to other minors who were trolling on the psych engine repo. https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/pull/11150, I don't know what happened to me, they refused to stop, and then something in me snapped, and I went insane. I proceeded to post NSFW on that post to get those trolls to stop, but I never realized this would break the promise between me & Levi (https://github.com/LEVIXDDLMAO) who is also a minor, and this would also end up with me getting banned from the repo. I don't know if I can live with myself after what went down, and I hope I can find redemption in myself, and others who were there. I have made a PR to help apologize https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/pull/11163, and also an issue that has now been deleted by ShadowMario, but I still have it here. https://pastebin.com/55SWU6ye
Thank you Levi for being a good friend, you were & are an amazing person, I'm so sorry for what I've done to hurt you, and to all my friends, thank you all, I've learned to socialize a lot more because of you all. I'm not leaving Github, and I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. So yeah, I just wanted to get this out to those I've hurted, and with my words, I hope you all can forgive me, even with time. I just hope you all can find it in your hearts to forgive me aswell...So..

With love & respect, and all of my sorrows.. -MemeHoovy

# More thoughts
even if you broke our promise, I forgive you, but you need help, as you said, you would get the help need, witch you really need no matter you gave me time to think, I thought about it, talked about with my mother. she had tons of good reason to forgive you, we all make mistakes, like me i fucked up with posting anything about this, it really hurt. so i had to give it off my chest this dosen't mean i hate you as i stated alot i dont pick sides because you fucked up and the trollers did too, I forgive you, you are like a brother to me, i dont want anything to happen to you,
